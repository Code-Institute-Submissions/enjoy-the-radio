# Enjoy The Radio!!

This is my second **Code Institute** milestone product about *Interactive Frontend Development*.

On this website I want to show you a radio application so you can enjoy listening to free radio over the internet.

## UX

### User stories
- As a radio lover, you can select a country and one of its radio stations to listen to it in the application.
- The countries and radio stations that you will find on this site are those that are listed in [Radio Browser Community](http://www.radio-browser.info/gui/#!/).
- You can access the official site of the radio station.

### Mockups

The mockups for the project are done on the [Vectr](https://vectr.com/) page, which is basically a page to draw pictures. This time it was very practical for me to do it this way. Here some examples:
